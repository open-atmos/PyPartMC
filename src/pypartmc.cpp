             Aerosol material properties and associated data.
 
             The data in this structure is constant, as it represents physical
             quantities that cannot change over time.
   
             Each aerosol species is identified by an index <tt>i =
             1,...,aero_data_n_spec(aero_data)</tt>. Then \c name(i) is the name of
             that species, \c density(i) is its density, etc. The ordering of the
             species is arbitrary and should not be relied upon (currently it is the
             order in the species data file). The only exception is that it is
             possible to find out which species is water from the \c i_water
             variable.
  
             The names of the aerosol species are not important to PartMC, as
             only the material properties are used. The names are used for
             input and output, and also for communication with MOSAIC. For the
             MOSAIC interface to work correctly the species must be named the
             same, but without the \c _a suffix.
